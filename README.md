<h2>About</h2>

This project was completed as part of NYU Shanghai's Spring 2017 Intro to Computer Science course.

<h2>Goal and requirements</h2>

This project aimed to extend the features of a Python chat server, created by Introduction to Computer Science Professor Zheng Zhang, based on the skills we learned during the course. I wrote the `deck.py` file to introduce a Dealer Bot to chat rooms and functionality to send users private messages from the server based on their input. The Dealer Bot has access to a 52-card deck and the ability to keep track of the score and the player's information. The example game included is an implementation of Go Fish.

<h2>Key learnings</h2>

- Working inside of a project written by someone else.  
- Developing with extensiblity in mind. 
- Independently reaching a working understanding of code written by a more experienced programmer.
- Creating a finished product that provides utility to its users.

<h2>Installation and usage</h2>

1. Download this project as zip and extract it.
2. To run the server, open a terminal window and run `chat_server.py`.
3. To join the server, open a terminal window and run `chat_cmdl_client.py`.
4. Clients connect with other peers with `c [peer_name]`.
5. Once connected, start the Dealer Bot by typing `play`.
